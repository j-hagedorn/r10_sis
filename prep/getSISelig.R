# Determination for IDD Consumers who require a SIS Assessment

# 1. Pick a query timeframe based on the most current information for each person.

# 2. Extract all IDD Consumers for the time period.  This uses the data from 1 of 
#    the following methods to obtain all IDD consumers.
#    a.  Use the IDD field in the QI file to see if it is a 1 (yes) if so the 
#        consumer is selected.
#    b.  If the IDD field is blank or null we then look at the three DD Proxy 
#        Measures. The three DD Proxy measures used are:
#        Support with Mobility, Support with Personal Care, and Status of Family/Friend Support.
#        If any of these proxy measures are populated, the consumer is selected.
#   c. Parameters are: 
#       18 years or older, 
#       who have an intellectual or developmental disability, 
#       have Medicaid/Healthy MI Medicaid, and 
#       are currently receiving case management or supports coordination or respite only services.
# 3. Next, check Encounters to get the denominator.
#     a. Case Management: T1017; 
#        Supports Coordination: T1016; 
#        Respite: H0045,S5151, T1005, T2036 or T2037; 
#        Other services H0036 (home based) or H0039 (assertive community treatment).
